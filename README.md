# liri-node-app

This app was a homework assignment for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.  Think of it like SIRI, but in this case you communicate with the app via node.  Commands accepted include: my-tweets, spotify-this-song, movie-this, and do-what-it-says.  Please include a song or movie for the spotify-this-song and movie-this commands.  Feel free to edit the random.txt file to change what happens with the do-what-it-says command.
